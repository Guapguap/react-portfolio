                My name is Alberto Londono and I have started my jounrey in coding. I am still exploring the many path careers within coding but Software Engineer appeals to me the most at the moment. I enjoy refining my skills on mini projects and seeing what else I can learn from it. Aside from my professional side, I enjoy anime, cooking for loved ones, and riding my skateboard.
